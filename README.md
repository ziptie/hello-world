Note about zipties, they're great at tying things up.  If one uses them outside then the black uv-stabilized plastic ones are preferred.  The white ones will become brittle and crack after less than a year in the sun.  For high heat, stainless zipties are a good choice, such as for affixing exhaust header wrap.
